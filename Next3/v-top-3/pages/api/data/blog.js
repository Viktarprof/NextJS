    title: "Interview With Anton Petrov, CEO of MEGAPARTNERS, for AskGamblers",
    dateTime: "5-30-2023",
    info: "For the latest AskGamblers interview, we talked to Anton Petrov, CEO of MEGAPARTNERS, a fresh and fledgling affiliate program, with intentions to take the iGaming world by storm. Currently, the program has three casinos under its belt, Megaslot Casino, Unislots Casino, and Megaslot.io Casino. Will they introduce more casinos? How do they intend to conquer iGaming? Learn all about MEGAPARTNERS in our exclusive interview. Anton, please introduce yourself. What experience do you have? What projects were you head of? I have been working in online advertising for 12 years. 6 of them — in gambling. Before MEGAPARTNERS, I worked as Head of Affiliate / CMO at Boomerang Partners. As part of my previous experience, I began to understand that to develop an affiliate program successfully, it is necessary to control all departments, products, analysts, retention, and VIP managers. Entering MEGAPARTNERS as CEO is a logical continuation. Tell us a bit about MEGAPARTNERS, its strategy, and plans.  MEGAPARTNERS is an independent company with its own strategy, which includes creating and developing our iGaming brands. And we also will hire only professionals and intend to use their expertise. This synergy will help us to influence and develop the industry. Our plans also include the development of new own products and the expansion of the affiliate partners base. This will bring us even more drive and entertainment to our work. What does the new redesign bring to members of your casino? Please, share some of the new options/features with our readers. In fact, this is not just a redesign but a full-fledged rebranding, a rethinking of the brand. We have formed the brand’s positioning and mission and identified the focuses we need. We reinvented the logo and formed the slogan «HOUSE OF GAMBLING».  We have created elements that are not just «dangling», but are an extension of the brand’s strategy.",
